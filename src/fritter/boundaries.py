            have been called.

        @param current: the time at which the current invocation I{actually}
            occurred; i.e. the time that the event loop got around to actually
            calling the function.

        @note: The delta between the reference time and the current time will
            I{often} be quite small.  If a system is running actively and is
            not overloaded, then this delta will be close to zero.  However,
            there are cases (some examples: a laptop goes to sleep, then wakes
            up hours later; a program schedules a call in a database and is not
            run for several weeks) when this delta can be very large.

        @return: a 2-tuple of:

                1. I{steps}; the recurrences that were expected to have
                   occurred between C{reference} and the I{current time}.  So
                   for example, for a L{RecurrenceRule} representing a
                   once-every-5-seconds recurrence, if your reference time were
                   1.0 and your current time were 15.0, then your step count
                   should be 2, since recurrences should have occurred at 6.0
                   and 11.0.  Alternately, for a C{RecurrenceRule[float,
                   list[float]]} with the same scheduled times, C{steps} will
                   be C{[6.0, 11.0]}.

                2. I{next reference time}; time at which the next recurrence
                   I{should} occur.  In our previous example, where our
                   reference time was 1.0 and current time was 15.0, the next
                   desired time should be 16.0, since that's the next 5-second
                   recurrence after 11.0.
